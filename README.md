# 🧠 MLP Assignment 3
**Machine Learning Practice – IIT Madras BS Degree Program**

---

## 📘 Overview
This repository holds my **Assignment 3** for the *Machine Learning Practice (MLP)* course, a core component of the **IIT Madras BS Degree** program.
This project covers a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from initial **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data preprocessing** to building, comparing, and **tuning multiple machine learning models** for a predictive task.

## ⚙️ Key Steps

-   Performed a thorough **EDA** to understand the dataset's structure and uncover initial insights.
-   Cleaned and **preprocessed the data** by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
-   Applied **feature scaling** to numerical columns and **encoding** to categorical columns to prepare the data for modeling.
-   Built, trained, and evaluated **at least seven different machine learning models**.
-   Systematically **compared model performances** to identify the top contenders.
-   Conducted **hyperparameter tuning** on the three best models to further boost their predictive power.
-   Selected the final, **best-performing model** for the submission.
